# music_stream
## Overview
A Django web application for dynamically serving music. Originally designed so that I could share my music collection with my family without needing to keep putting it on flash drives for them, it became a bit of a pet project so I could have something to showcase for job applications.

If for some reason you decide to clone this repo for something, you'll need to get some icon files for things like play/pause buttons, etc. If you dig around in the HTML, you should be able to find all the filenames you need. Similarly, you'll need your own Django settings file since that isn't uploaded here.
